    # TIMER RELAY
    
    Version: 1.3
    
    
    The most common automation used for a Timer Relay (also known as a "Run on Timer"). Select a trigger and its desired state. Then set the delay time in seconds, minutes & 4 hours. The entity will turn OFF after the time period expires.

    The Automation Process:
      - When the trigger is activated, it turns the selected entity (lights, fan, motor etc.) ON and then OFF automatically in a pre-set time period. You can have as many triggers and entities as you like.
      - The entity will stay ON if the trigger has been activated again before the time delay turns the entity OFF. It will then reset the time delay after the last trigger event.
